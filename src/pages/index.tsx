              Hi there ðŸ‘‹I&#x27;m Ghazi Ramadan form the United States of ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
              American.

              graph designer with programming (and creative coding in general)
              in my free time. Professional Landscape Designer with several
              years of experience working with clients to create and enhance the
              aesthetics and function of natural outdoor spaces. The ability to
              understand and fulfill a client&#x27;s vision is what sets us
              apart as a design and horticulture company. Design, manage, and
              plan projects of all sizes, from small to very large. My
              communication and collaboration skills make me a dynamic,
              dedicated professional. Thank you ðŸ¦•
